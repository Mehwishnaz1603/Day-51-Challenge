// 1. Apply Your Theoretical Knowledge Practically (Practice, Practice, Practiceâ€¦)
// 2. Donâ€™t Leave a Gap in Your Learning
// 3. Donâ€™t do Over Analysis of the Concept
// 4. Read The Error Message Carefully
// 5. Solve the MCQs Questions in Programming
// 6. Code With Hands
// 8. Enhance Your Problem-Solving Skills
// 9. Divide Things into Smaller Parts
// 10. Find a Perfect Mentor
// Conclusion
// Remember that learning the first programming language always requires special effort. Programming also needs a lot of patience and practice. 
// Initially, you will struggle and you will try to give up but thatâ€™s the moment when you need to have the patience to solve the questions. 

// Your brain needs exercise to solve questions in programming and it will only come with practice. Start with smaller problems and train your
// brain to solve simple problems first then move to the next level or some complex problem. You canâ€™t solve the mathematics problems of the
// 10th standard if your brain is not trained enough to solve the problems of the 9th standard. So donâ€™t skip the question and move level by
// level in coding.
